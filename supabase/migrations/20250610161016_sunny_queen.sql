  # Fix Avatar Storage RLS Policies

  This migration fixes the Row Level Security policies for the avatars storage bucket.
  The current policies are incorrectly extracting the user ID from the file path.
  
  ## Changes:
  1. Drop existing storage policies that are causing the RLS violation
  2. Create new policies with correct user ID extraction from filename
  
  ## Security:
  - Users can only upload/update/delete their own avatar files
  - Public can view all avatars
  - File naming convention: {user_id}.{extension}
